# Past WWDC Scholarship Submissions

This repository contains my past WWDC Scholarship submissions. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to help preserve all my past submissions, share my successes, and reflect on my failures. 

## What's contained

**\[NEW\]** From 2019 on, the individual WWDC Scholarship submission projects will be hosted in separate repositories, with this repository being the catalog that links to all submission repositories. 

\[Deprecated\] Each folder includes the original playground and other supporting files submitted with it. Anything related with personal information will be removed. 
Archives in this repository will be the original submissions ONLY. Future edits and modifications will instead either be available in other repositories or not be available at all.
